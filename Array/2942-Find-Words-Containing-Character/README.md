## 📝 Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a character `x`.

Return *an **array of indices** representing the words that contain the character *`x`.

**Note** that the returned array may be in **any** order.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
**Output:** [0,1]
**Explanation:** "e" occurs in both words: "l**ee**t", and "cod**e**". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
**Output:** [0,2]
**Explanation:** "a" occurs in "**a**bc", and "**aaaa**". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= words.length <= 50`

	- `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`

	- `x` is a lowercase English letter.

	- `words[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.
